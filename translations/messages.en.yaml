    Roleplay?

    role-playing is a kind of board game... only better! Here, you embody a character like an actor (even without talent!):
    you live adventures, challenges, mysteries and even romances through the skin of your avatar. And this,
    in a group usually composed of 4 to 5 players and a game master.
    <br><br>
    Whether you're a fantasy lover, a science fiction buff or a horror amateur... role-playing
    gives you hours of fun and is only limited by your imagination.
